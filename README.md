# ITIDA-data-analysis-project
This is the capstone project for the diploma "Data Analysis Professional Track" jointly offered by Egypt's ITIDA & Udacity. It is an open ended project, where each student chooses one of 5 available datasets, and does extensive analysis on it.

I chose a dataset that has information from 100k medical appoitnments in Brazil, and focuses on the question of whether or not patients show up for the appointment (original source on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments).

I posed 7 questions at the start of the analysis, and then analysed the dataset from multiple angles to come up with answers.

The full analysis and code are available as a Jupyter Notebook inside the file Project.ipynb, GitHub doesn't render HTML links correctly though, so you wouldn't be able to use links to different sections of the notebook if you view it in GitHub.

Alternatively, you can view it on the link: https://nbviewer.org/github/AMMarei/ITIDA-data-analysis-project/blob/main/Project.ipynb, where links render correctly.
