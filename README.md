# ITIDA-data-analysis-project
This is the capstone project for the diploma "Data Analysis Professional Track" jointly offered by Egypt's ITIDA & Udacity. It is an open ended project, where each student chooses one of 5 available datasets, and does extensive analysis on it.

I chose a dataset that has information from 100k medical appoitnments in Brazil, and focuses on the question of whether or not patients show up for the appointment (original source on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments).

I posed 7 questions at the start of the analysis, and then the dataset has been analysed from multiple angles to come up with answers.

The full analysis and code are available in 2 formats: .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook), and .html (HTML). Please refer to the files Project.ipynb & Project.html.
